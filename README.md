# Object management tutorial


The code is written by me but comes from an object management tutorial by Jasper Flick. You can read it [here](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/object-management/). A repository is created to help me keep track of my progress in the tutorial. 

## Main concepts learned:
* Saving and loading game state, with keeping backward compatibility
* Factory pattern
* Pooling objects

## Other things learned:
* Working with binary files in C#
* Working with ScriptableObject class
* Working with PropertyBlock and GPU instancing to get better performance
